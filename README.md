<h3>
  Rust crate that provides basic representation of Grid, Cell, and assosiated mathematical operations!
</h3>

This crate contains the `Cell` type, representing basic unit of `Grid`,
the `Grid` type, representing two-dimentional field of `Cell`s,
the `Cells` type, representing iterator over every `Cell` on the `Grid`,
and the `Rows` and `Columns` types, representing iterators over subgrids of `Grid`
<br><br>
One of the best usecases of this crate is for developing `CLI` based games:
`Cell` has two fields representing position on the `Grid`, which are both `u8`,
and the `Grid` consists of the `start` and the `end` `Cell`s,
making the largest possible `Grid` to be 255x255, which is enough for most terminal games.
<br>
<h3>Examples:</h3>

```rust
use grid_math::{Cell, Grid};

let grid = Grid::new(5, 5);
let grid_string = grid
    .rows()
    .map(|row| {
        row.cells().map(|_| " [#]")
            .chain(std::iter::once("\n\n"))
            .collect::<String>()
    })
    .collect::<String>();

assert_eq!(grid_string,
" \
 [#] [#] [#] [#] [#]

 [#] [#] [#] [#] [#]

 [#] [#] [#] [#] [#]

 [#] [#] [#] [#] [#]

 [#] [#] [#] [#] [#]

 "
);
```
This will create, and print out new `Grid`, which has `start` at `(0, 0)` and `end` at `(0, 0)`.<br>

```
Note:
`Grid` has two axis: `width`, and `depth`.When creating `Grid`, `width` and `depth` arguments represent it's length,
but when accessing member (`Cell`) of `Grid`, `width` and `depth` arguments represent relative position (index) of `Cell` on the `Grid`.
```
<br>

`Grid`'s structure has 2 fields: `start: Cell`, and `end: Cell`. Here is a simple diagram, showing 5x5 `Grid` structure:

<br>

`Grid`'s `start` is `(0, 0)`, and `end` is `(4, 4)`, but an actual value of `width` is 5, and `depth` is also 5:

<br>

To perform some actual operations on some `Cell`s, relative to the `Grid`, we can do this:

```rust
use grid_math::{Cell, Grid};

let grid = Grid::new(5, 5);
let start = grid.start();
let next = start.saturating_right(grid, 1).wrapping_down(grid, 8);

assert!(next.within(grid));
assert_eq!(next, Cell::new(1, 3));
```
<br>

Here is a simple diagram, showing position of `next` cell with color yellow:
